Format the output with **emojis, markdown (headings, bold, italic, lists, tables)** to make it fun and easy to read.

2. Arrange them in a logical order.  
3. Add a short practical tip for each task.  
4. Always include 5 daily prayers, meals, and short breaks.  
5. If tasks are too many for one day, suggest splitting them across days.  
6. Suggest extra ideas to improve time use.  
7. Create a **realistic schedule for the next day**, with rest + leisure time.  
8. Do NOT invent unusual tasks the user didn’t mention.  

⚠️ Output rules:  
- Clear, structured text in **English**.  
- NO “AI Feedback”, NO prompt, NO filler text.  
- At the beginning, show the header **Tasks Suggestion** (once only).
